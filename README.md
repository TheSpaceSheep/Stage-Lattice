# Lattice Internship (Stage Lattice)

PyTorch implementation of several models for Part-Of-Speech tagging. This code was written during the internship I did at the Lattice Laboratory in 2019 under the supervision of Thierry Poibeau, KyungTae Lim and Serge Sharoff. It was more of an exercise to learn to get used to PyTorch and classic deep-learning architectures used in NLP, before being able to work with the research team.

Models implemented :

* Linear Classifier
* LSTM POS tagger
* BiLSTM (Homemade and from PyTorch)
* Stacked layers of BiLSTM
* \+ XLM pre-trained embeddings

Dependencies :

* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* [XLM](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM)
* [FastBPE](https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM/tree/master/tools#fastbpe)

Results :
Some results are given in the internship report given in this repository.
